## What is it?

NBSite lets you build a website from a set of notebooks plus a minimal
amount of config. Sites built with nbsite include
[pyviz.org](https://pyviz.org),
[datashader.org](http://datashader.org/), and [hvplot.pyviz.org](https:/hvplot.pyviz.org).

The idea behind nbsite is that notebooks can simultaneously be
documentation (things you want to tell people about), examples (a
starting point for people to run and use themselves), and test cases.

This project is currently an early work in progress. See the
documentation at [nbsite.pyviz.org](https://nbsite.pyviz.org) for
more information.
