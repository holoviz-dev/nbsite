    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want a 'static', fairly self contained site (i.e. just an ordinary web server is required - you can build and serve locally, or copy the build directory to a remote server).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You have one or more sets of notebooks (e.g. `notebooks/`, or `examples/getting_started` + `examples/user_guide` + `examples/gallery`). Note: current expectation is for there to be no title in the notebook itself; instead, the title will be taken from filename. E.g. `1_The_Filename.ipynb` will result in a title of `1 The Filename`. Additionally, notebooks should use level 2 headings as their highest heading level (level 1 will used for the title). However, all of this may change - see [issue 18](https://github.com/pyviz/nbsite/issues/18).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The packages used by the notebooks are already installed in the environment into which you will install nbsite.\n",

    "5. You are using mac or linux (might work on windows, but currently untested)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You are using holoviews for visualization (other packages might work, or no having holoviews might work, but currently untested; if you don't have holoviews, you will at least need to override `nbbuild_ipython_startup` in `conf.py`, setting it to e.g. `\"\"`)."
