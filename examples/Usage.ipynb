    "1. You want a 'static', fairly self contained site (i.e. just an ordinary web server is required - you can build and serve locally, or copy the build directory to a remote server).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You have one or more sets of notebooks (e.g. `notebooks/`, or `examples/getting_started` + `examples/user_guide` + `examples/gallery`). Note: current expectation is for there to be no title in the notebook itself; instead, the title will be taken from filename. E.g. `1_The_Filename.ipynb` will result in a title of `1 The Filename`. If there is a title in the notebook, then the `offset` flag can be used to remove the first cell before rendering. Notebooks should use level 2 headings as their highest heading level (level 1 will used for the title). However, all of this may change - see [issue 18](https://github.com/pyviz/nbsite/issues/18).\n",

    "5. You are using mac or linux (might work on windows, but currently untested)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Currently, you need to have holoviews available in your environment. Other packages (bokeh, matplotlib, plotly) can be used for visualization in addition to holoviews, but if you don't have holoviews in the environment, you will at least need to override `nbbuild_ipython_startup` in `nbbuild.py`, setting it to e.g. `\"\"`."
